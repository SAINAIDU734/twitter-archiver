# Make your own simple, public, searchable Twitter archive

This is a static website that you can run. It is a website that takes in your Twitter archive zip file, in the format that it is provided circa December 2022, and generates a zip file with another website in it.

Feel free to hack on this if you want it to generate different output than what is available at https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/
